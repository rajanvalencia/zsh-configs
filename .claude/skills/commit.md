---

Create a git commit without Claude Code attribution.

## Instructions

1. Check git status to see what changes exist
2. Show the user the diff of changes that will be committed
3. Create a commit with ONLY the user's message - do NOT add:
   - The ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code footer
   - The Co-Authored-By: Claude line
   - Any other Claude attribution

## Important Rules

- NO attribution footers whatsoever
- Keep the commit message exactly as the user provides
- This is for when the user wants full credit for the changes
